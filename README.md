### ü¶ø Humanoid Robot Walking Engine

This repository contains the **core component** of our **end-to-end walking pipeline**, developed as part of my [PhD research](https://ria.ua.pt/bitstream/10773/33545/1/Documento_Seyed_Kasaei.pdf). It presents a robust framework for generating walking gaits in humanoid robots.

#### üîß Key Features:
- üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Hybrid Walking Engine**: Combines the **Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM)** with **Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)** for trajectory generation.
- üß† **State Machine Control**: A modular finite-state machine orchestrates the phases of the walking cycle.
- üîÑ **Smooth Gait Generation**: Utilizes **Partial Fourier Series (PFS) oscillators** to produce smooth and continuous joint trajectories.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Stabilization Controllers**: Includes feedback mechanisms for dynamic stability during locomotion.
- ü§ñ **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Successfully deployed on multiple humanoid platforms including:
  - **COMAN**
  - **Talos**
  - **Nao**

This implementation is a cornerstone of my doctoral work and contributes to the broader goal of enabling reliable, dynamic locomotion in humanoid robots.

# Installation and Setup

## Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MohammadKasaei/HumanoidWalking.git
cd HumanoidWalking
```
## Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional):

```
python3 -m venv walking_env
source walking_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `walking_env\Scripts\activate`
```
## Install Dependencies:
Before running the script, make sure you have execute permissions. Run the following command:
```
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```
To install all the dependencies, simply run:
```
./install_dependencies.sh
```
Wait for the script to complete. Once done, all the required dependencies should be installed in your environment.


## Usage 
Instructions on how to run the code, experiments, and reproduce results.
```
python3 Coman_CPG.py
```
Once everything successfully installed, you'll see the simulated COMAN while **walking forward** within the PyBullet simulator.

Additionally, by running the following command, you'll see the simulated Talos robot performing **omnidirectional walking**.
```
python3 Talos_CPG.py
```
